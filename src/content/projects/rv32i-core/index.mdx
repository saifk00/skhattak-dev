  This is my implementation of the RV32I base spec. I completed the basic pipeline as a school project, and I've been working on it
  in my spare time to give it some more interesting features. The first step was to unify the instruction and data memory modules into one
  dual-read single-write module, so that I could write to instruction memory (allowing for the <code> Zifencei </code> extension) and allow for a unified
  cache underneath the instruction/data caches.
  The next step was to implement some dynamic branch prediction and then move on to the CSR registers to allow for interrupt handling. The
  whole thing is built by CMake using verilator to make simulations for each of the
