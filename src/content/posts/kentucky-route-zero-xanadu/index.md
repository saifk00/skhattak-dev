  In Act III of the magical Bob Dylan song turned game
  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/231200/Kentucky_Route_Zero_PC_Edition/" target="_blank">Kentucky Route Zero</a>,
  the player enters a cavern populated by a professor and his research team. What exactly they are researching is unclear, but they've been working on it for a long time.
  The centerpiece of the scene is <b>Xanadu</b>, a computer whose circuits have become coated with the mold that grows in the cave, and which may be poisoning the minds
  of the team (or represents it? I admit I'm not great at literary analysis). Originally designed as a revolutionary computer system, it has since fallen into decay. However, upon repairing
  it, the player finds the mold has given the computer abilities beyond the imagination of its original designers - the mold has given it some seed of chaos, and it has learned to
  perform a simulation of the events leading up to its own creation.

  An amusing scene, undercut by my lackluster explanation. The name <b>Xanadu</b> is a reference to a lot of things. The most compelling of these is to the first hypertext project:
  <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Project_Xanadu" target="_blank"><b>Project Xanadu</b></a>. In the 1960s, long before even the concept of a word processor existed, Ted Nelson
  (who coined the term hypertext) had a vision echoed by the research team hidden away in the cave of Kentucky Route Zero. A vision vast in scope and often described in flowery language about
  freedom, individuality, and the future and potential of computing, Nelson claims that modern Hypertext is nothing but a simulacrum of paper, and a corruption of his original vision.
  The project never came to fruition, though the organization still exists and a 'working deliverable' was released in 2014. The key idea, whose essence continues on in the modern web,
  was that of a user journeying through a universe of text made up of references to other elements of said universe. So in the spirit of that vision, here are some links to stuff that I
  find interesting.
